Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the AI Python Developer role at Konfuzio. I am confident that I can contribute to your team and aid in achieving your organization's objectives.

I am an energy engineer who has transitioned to the software industry. I possess experience in Python backend for Network Automation, Machine Learning, and payment systems, and I have utilized all the requisite skills outlined in the job description.

I am a fast learner who invests in hard and soft skills, such as mental toughness and discipline, which I practice through martial arts. My first love is my daughter, and my second is surfing. Mind and body must be connected to achieve the best of yourself.

I appreciate your consideration for the position. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you need more information or want to discuss my candidacy further.

Sincerely,
Rodrigo Lucchesi
